# My Library

This project is a web application that allows users to manage their personal book collections. Users can create an account, add books to their library, categorize them, and keep track of their reading progress.

### Features

* User registration and profile management.
* Books CRUD - users can create books, edit and update book information and delete books from the library.
* Create categories and assign the books to one or more of them.
* Keep the reading progress of each book using page count and mark books as read or unread.
* Display statistics and insights about the user's library (total number of books, books read, and reading progress).
